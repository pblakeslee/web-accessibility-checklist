              ADA website compliance essentially comes down to making your
              website conformant with the
              <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA technical standards.</strong>

            <p>
              There actually is no law for private entities in the U.S. that
              mandates web accessibility. The law that primarily governs accessibility in the U.S. is the
              <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</strong> The gist
              of the ADA is if you don’t make things accessible, then you’re
              discriminating against those with disabilities.

              There are different versions (1.0, 2.0, 2.1) and conformance
              levels (A, AA, AAA) for WCAG but the two most important ones are
              <strong> WCAG 2.0 AA</strong> and <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA</strong>

                do to make your website more accessible.</strong
              >
              2.0 is the classic standard and 2.1 is the current standard. 2.0
              was published in 2008 so it’s missing some key mobile
              accessibility issues. It’s helpful to know that 2.1 AA includes
              all of 2.0 AA.

              But, just because our website doesn’t fully meet a WCAG success
            criterion doesn’t mean we’re in violation of the ADA. Until the DOJ adopts specific technical requirements for web
              accessibility in a final rule, if you’re subject to the ADA,
              <strong

              Some of these 50 to-dos are much more critical than others (both
              in terms of accessibility and legal risk). Two big accessibility
              items in lawsuits are <strong> 1. missing alt text</strong> and
              <strong>2. missing labels.</strong>

                Try your best to meet as many of the WCAG success criteria as best you can. <strong>Also, ask yourself the following two questions:</strong>
                <ol>
                  <li>What is the primary purpose of my website?</li>
                    <li>What are the common paths that visitors take once they’re on my website?</li>

are clear of any barriers that could potentially prevent access or cause frustration.
